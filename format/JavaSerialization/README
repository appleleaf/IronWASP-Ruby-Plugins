Summary:
========
This plugin can be used to convert JavaSerialized objects to XML and back which can be processed by IronWASP for individual request/responses or fuzzing.

Usage:
======
The main component of this plugin is JavaSerialization.jar that can be found in the <IRONWASP>\format\JavaSerialization\lib\java folder. This can be used as a standalone jar as follows:

java -jar JavaSerialization.jar <base64 string> <xml | java>

where
<base64 string> - JAVA Serialized object array in base64 format OR XML version of the JAVA object array converted by XStream in base64 format
<xml | java> - keywords for conversion in the desired format. "xml" would convert JAVA object array to XML and "java" would convert XML to Java object array in base64 format

This can be used within IronWASP from the Body tab of the individual Request/Response, or the scripting shell similar to other format plugins.

IMPORTANT:
===========
Before using the plugin, place all the client side jars (You must have these if you are testing a thick client or applets) in the <IRONWASP>\format\JavaSerialization\lib\clientlibs folder. This is necessary to resolve any custom JAVA classes used by the application in the serialized objects.
